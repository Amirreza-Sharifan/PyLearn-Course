# Classification whit KNN algorithm
This project includes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model used for classifying different types of fruits (apple, banana, and watermelon).
### Description
In this project, we use the KNN model to classify three types of fruits (apple, banana, and watermelon). The model is trained on the features of the fruit data and then used to predict the type of new fruits.
