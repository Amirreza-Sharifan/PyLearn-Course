# Data_Set_Numbers
The Python code in this section processes an image containing various representations of numbers from 0 to 9. The code reads the image, crops it into separate sections for each number, and saves the cropped sections into specific folders.
### Explanation
- **Reading the Image:** The image is read in grayscale mode using OpenCV.
- **Displaying the Image:** The image is displayed using matplotlib to visualize the input.
- **Cropping the Image:** The image is divided into ten sections, each representing a different number from 0 to 9.
- **Creating Output Directories:** For each number, a directory is created if it doesn't already exist.
- **Saving Cropped Images:** Each section is further subdivided, and the resulting smaller images are saved into their respective directories.
- This code helps in organizing and preparing a dataset of images representing different numbers, which can be useful for machine learning tasks such as digit recognition.

## Personal Practice
### Matplotlib
In the matplotlib section, I engaged in exercises that covered:

- Basic plotting functions
- Customizing plots with titles, labels, and legends
- Creating various types of plots such as line plots, bar charts, and histograms
- Adjusting plot aesthetics and styles
### Machine Learning
In the machine learning section, I practiced:
- **1- Mean, Median, Mode:** Calculating and understanding these basic statistical measures to summarize data.
- **2- Standard Deviation:** Measuring the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.
- **3- Percentile:** Understanding the value below which a given percentage of observations in a dataset falls.
- **4- Data Distribution:** Visualizing and analyzing how data is spread across different values.
- **5- Normal Data Distribution:** Studying the properties of normally distributed data, which follows a bell curve.
- **6- Scatter Plot:** Creating scatter plots to identify relationships between two variables.
- **7- Linear Regression:** Implementing linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable.
- **8- Polynomial Regression:** Extending linear regression to model relationships using polynomial terms.
- **9- Multiple Regression:** Modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- **10- Scale:** Normalizing or standardizing data to bring all variables to a common scale.
